There are total 2 scripts I have made one is simple script which is just first testing the API is working fine or not and
the 2nd one I have made in Page Object Model Design Pattern in which some of the ES6 features like classes and objects I have used.

About the improvements first then if there is no value in the textbox and user clicks on Submit then noting happnes the screen
just loads and loads , in this case there should be some validation error.

Maybe If we don't want to allow user to enter negative number then for that we should add Validation error cause for every negative number the mediun is gonna be [,]

the 1st simple script name is assignment.spec.js
and 2nd script name is MainPage.spec.js (I have used little bit of POM model in this script , this script could be made more dynamic by adding inheritence and using constructer in the scripts but I have made this only to give some big picture of the ES6 features)
